Led Strip</b></font></font></p>
<p>Intro:</p>
<p>This is the write-up for my internet controlled LED strip. The
final product is an LED strip connected to the Internet, hosting a
webpage that allows anyone choose the strips current light
configuration. This project touches on most everything I know about
computers from assembly-level bit banging and other low-level
hardware interaction, to installing and administering Linux systems,
to creating programs that work together in a variety of languages, as
well as web development.</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi is connected to the network, and hosting a
webpage. On the page there is a form that when submitted, causes the
server to execute a program that sends data about what LEDs to light
up to the Arduino. The Arduino then interprets the data and tells the
LED strip what LEDs to light up. Pretty simple right?</p>
<p>Parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>1x → Raspberry Pi + SD card (at least 8GB) + power cable</p>
	<li><p>1x → Arduino (Mega for me, most should work)</p>
	<li><p>1x → Radioshack LED strip (will post link to specific one)</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>This can be substituted for individual LEDs and TM1801?
		Chips</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>2x → Female → Male jumper wires</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>For the RPi → Arduino Connection</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>1x → 12v power supply</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The LED strip requires 12v (see below)</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>1x Ethernet Cable</p>
</ul>
<p>What you should know/will learn (Topics Covered):</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Programming Languages</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>C/C++ → For the Arduino (<i>also noip client I use had to
		be compiled from source)</i></p>
		<li><p>Python → Used by the Raspberry Pi to send data to the
		Arduino via serial</p>
		<li><p>BASH → Used by PHP for backend execution (namely to call
		the Python script...)</p>
		<li><p>PHP → Used to auto-generate the webpage, as well call the
		BASH script that calls the Python scripts.</p>
		<li><p>HTML → This isn't really a “programming” language but
		is what browser used to render webpages</p>
		<li><p>Bonus (Not neccessary): Javascript/CSS → Make the site
		look pretty and do cool things</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Other Computer Stuff</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Hardware interaction</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Interfacing with TM1801? LED driver</p>
			<li><p>Using serial communication</p>
		</ul>
		<li><p>Software:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Installing/Configuring a Linux distribution to work for you</p>
			<li><p>Compiling/building programs from source as well as using
			scripting languages</p>
			<li><p>Configuring Apache web server 
			</p>
			<li><p>Hexadecimal/Binary</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p align="center">Where to begin...</p>
<p align="left">To me it seems logical to start with the lowest level
we're dealing with...hardware.</p>
<p align="left">Arduino + LED strip:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="left">The LED strip's driver chip must receive a
	specially designed pulse to display colors.</p>
	<li><p align="left">A certain pattern of Ons and Offs (High and Low
	Voltages) over the strips data line is used to encode a hexadecimal
	number representing the desired color.</p>
	<li><p align="left">The Arduino listens on the serial wire for a
	string of characters coming from RPi, if it receives one, it
	interprets them and sets the strip accordingly.</p>
	<li><p align="left"><a href=""Check the code for m</p>	
</ul>
<p align="left">Now for the backbone...</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi:</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi is main attraction. It hosts the website, waiting
for someone to click submit on the page. When someone does, it runs a
series of scripts that will end up sending out information about what
LEDs to light up to the Arduino via serial.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>led.php</p>
	<li><p>send-strip.sh</p>
	<li><p>send-serial.py</p>
</ul>
<p>Networking:</p>
<p>In order to properly host a page on your home network you may want
to set up your Pi with a static IP address.</p>
<p>If you're going to host it on the internet find out if your ISP
uses dynamic IP addressing</p>
<p>Web Server:</p>
<p>Use PHP to auto-generate webpages and execute server side programs
to do server things.</p>
